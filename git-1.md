## The Concepts of Git


### Clone

> "Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository, and creates and checks out an initial branch that is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s currently active branch."


<!-- .element: data-state="clone" -->
In easy words: Takes the whole repository...
<canvas id="clone-1"></canvas>

<div>...and copies it to your location.
<canvas id="clone-2"></canvas></div><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


<!-- .element: data-state="commit" -->
### Commit

> "You commit when you have reached a codebase state you want to remember."
